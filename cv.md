## Briefly about myself
I have a little experience in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Currently working on the research of imaging with audio waves.

I created sites during some courses studied in University that were connected to databases. I got curious about the frontend field and now I'm on my path to gain more experince in it. 

I'm eager to learn new things and to hone my skills.

## Code example
```
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {
  const words = this.split(" ")
  for (var i = 0; i < words.length; i++){
     words[i] = words[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase() + words[i].slice(1);
  }
  
  return words.join(" ");
};
```
